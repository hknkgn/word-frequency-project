# word-frequency-project
In this project, an algorithm was developed for the problem of combining two or more texts appropriately.

The program scans the 1st sentence from the last to the 2nd sentence, if it does not find any similarity, an algorithm is produced by looking at the beginning of the 1st sentence and the beginning of the 2nd sentence.
